# Active Context: Brain Dump App

## Current Focus
- Implementing core note-taking functionality
- Setting up basic Flask routes and templates
- Establishing database models

## Recent Changes
1. Initialized project structure
2. Created basic Flask application (app.py)
3. Set up virtual environment with required dependencies
4. Created initial HTML template (brain_dump.html)

## Next Steps
1. Implement Note model with SQLAlchemy
2. Create CRUD endpoints for notes
3. Develop basic UI for note creation/display
4. Add markdown rendering support

## Key Decisions
1. Using SQLite for initial development
2. Minimal server-side rendering (mostly JSON API)
3. Progressive enhancement with JavaScript

## Important Considerations
- Keep initial scope minimal (MVP)
- Focus on core note functionality first
- Ensure data persistence works reliably
- Maintain clean separation between layers
